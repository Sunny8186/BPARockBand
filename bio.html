                  <p class="band">I was born on May 22, 2005, in Toledo, Ohio. My parents were very poor,
                    and were eager to save up every cent they had in order to raise me well. My friends,
                    Luna and Ray, told me to start a band with them, and I agreed. I knew it would be my
                    only chance to become rich and famous.

                  <p class="band">I was born on June 2, 2004, in Sylvania, Ohio. I moved to Toledo when I was
                    5, where I met Jaxon and Ray. It was my idea that we should make up a rock band together,
                    because we were friends for so long. This goes to show that frienship can go a long way past childhood.

                  <p class="band">I was born on December 21, 2004, in Toledo, Ohio. I am the son of the famous
                    singer Billy Wilkinson, and it was he who persuaded me to start a musical career. I released
                    two albums as a solo artist, My Journey (2021) and Sunshine (2023), before starting the
                    band with my friends. I actually chose the name Stage Fright because it emphasized that we all had
                    to face our fears before we go big.
